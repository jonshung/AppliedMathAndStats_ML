<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A small collection of projects which I did during my enrollment in my university's AMAS-IT course.
<br/>
The collection is intended for educational uses and reports were mainly written in Vietnamese. Additional translation could be considered in the future if necessary.
<br/>
This collection SHOULD NOT and CAN NOT be used to encourage plagiarism. Any individual who violated one's institutate code of conduct should be responsible for one's own action.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Prerequisites

A new, fresh installation of Anaconda should be enough to run all the collection's projects.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Since this is a personal resource, I do not anticipate additional contribution to the repo. But if you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. I'll try to allocate time to review and push the changes as soon as possible.
